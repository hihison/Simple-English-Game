# Simple-English-Game
Through this program, the Junior form (S1-S3) students can review what they have learn in their school life . Chinese says “Reviewing the Old and you may learn new things from it (溫故而知新)”. 
I think this is a good program for them to learn new things by reviewing the old throught this game system.
It’s not difficult to study because it’s a game that match with their friends and classmates . Competition is a good way to improve yourself in a short time. I selected 2 games to be putted in the system : Riddle and Odd one out and here is the description of each game :



##1.	Riddle
###a game that provide student some hints and require them to input the vocabulary
For example : Vegetable(can be fruit) that pulp and skin in red color .
The answer is tomato

##2.	Odd one out
###A visual puzzle where the guesser has to choose which word/picture/symbol etc. does not fit with the others. 
For example :A.boy
					 B.girl
					 C.Female
           D.Women
The answer is A.boy
